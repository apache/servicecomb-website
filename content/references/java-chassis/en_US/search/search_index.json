Using this feature, all the requests sent to 3rd party service will be processed by consumer handler chain and HttpClientFilters, which means this feature allows service governance function on invoking 3rd party service, and other ServiceComb custom extension mechanism is also supported. Sample Code Assume that there is a REST 3rd party service, whose listen port is 8080, and rest interface contract is like below: ```yaml swagger: \"2.0\" info: version: \"0.0.1\" title: \"3rd party REST service for example\" basePath: \"/rest\" consumes: - \"application/json\" produces: - \"text/plain\" paths: /{pathVar}: get: operationId: \"testPathVar\" parameters: - name: \"pathVar\" in: \"path\" required: true type: \"string\" responses: 200: description: \"response of 200, return \\\"Received, OK. [${pathVar}]\\\"\" schema: type: \"string\" ``` To invoke this service, a java interface class should be written according to the rest contract and annotated by rest annotations. The way to write java interface class is similar to writing SpringMVC or JAX-RS style ServiceComb provider service. Interface code is like below: java @Path(\"/rest\") @Api(produces = MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) public interface VertxServerIntf { @Path(\"/{pathVar}\") @GET String testPathVar(@PathParam(\"pathVar\") String pathVar); } Register the information of 3rd party rest service on consumer side: java String endpoint = \"rest://127.0.0.1:8080\"; RegistryUtils.getServiceRegistry().registerMicroserviceMappingByEndpoints( // 3rd party rest service name, you can specify the name on your need as long as you obey the microservice naming rule \"thirdPartyService\", // service version \"0.0.1\", // list of endpoints Collections.singletonList(endpoint), // java interface class to generate swagger schema ThirdPartyRestServiceInterface.class ); Invoke 3rd party rest service in the way similar to invoking ServiceComb provider service.

For other frameworks, users need to configure the log file output options. Switch to logback For the project that uses logback, the log framework dependency should be changed from Log4j to logback with some extra configurations to make access log work. 1. Remove Log4j dependencies Before switching to logback, check the dependencies of the project and remove Log4j related dependencies. Run the maven command dependency:tree in the project, find the ServiceComb components that depend on Log4j, and add the following configuration to its <dependency> : <exclusion> <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId> <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId> </exclusion> 2. Add a logback dependency Add a dependency for the logback in the pom file: <dependency> <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId> <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId> <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId> <artifactId>logback-core</artifactId> </dependency> 3. Configure the logger for the access log component Since the log component provided by ServiceComb obtains the logger named accesslog for log printing, the key to log framework switching is to provide a file called accesslog and configure the output file for it. The following is a sample configuration of the access log for logback. It only shows the configurations related to the access log. Other log configurations are omitted: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <configuration> <!-- Users can customize the appender by their requirement --> <appender name=\"ACCESSLOG\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender\"> <file>./logs/access.log</file> <rollingPolicy class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy\"> <fileNamePattern>./logs/access-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log</fileNamePattern> </rollingPolicy> <!-- Note: the access log content is formatted in code, the pattern should only specify the message without extra format --> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- Provide a logger named \"accesslog\" for log printing --> <logger name=\"accesslog\" level=\"INFO\" additivity=\"false\"> <appender-ref ref=\"ACCESSLOG\" /> </logger> </configuration> Extending Access Log Users can customize their AccessLogItem by ServiceComb's AccessLogItem extension mechanism. Related classes AccessLogItem public interface AccessLogItem<T> { /** * Get specified content from accessLogParam, generate the access log and return */ String getFormattedItem(AccessLogParam<T> accessLogParam); } The definition of AccessLogItem is as shown above. When request triggers Access Log printing, ServiceComb's Access Log mechanism will traverse a valid AccessLogItem , call the getFormattedItem method to get the item's Access Log fragment, concatenate all the the fragments into an Access Log, and output it to the log file. The parameter AccessLogParam<T> contains the request start time, the end time, and the request context of type T . In the REST over Vert.x communication mode, the type T is the RoutingContext of Vert.x. VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta // pattern placeholder prefix protected String prefix; // pattern placeholder suffix protected String suffix; // order number of priority protected int order; // AccessLogItem constructor protected AccessLogItemCreator<RoutingContext> accessLogItemCreator; The VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta contains the properties listed above, it specifies how ServiceComb parse the pattern string to get specific AccessLogItem. To define a AccessLogItem with placeholder %user-defined , declare a subclass of VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta \uff0cset prefix=\"%user-defined\", suffix=null, when AccessLogPatternParser parses the \"%user-defined\", it will fetch the AccessLogItemCreator from the meta class and create the corresponding AccessLogItem . Note: since there is not variable in placeholder \"%user-defined\", the call to AccessLogItemCreator passes the configuration parameter null\u3002 To get a AccessLogItem with placeholder %{VARNAME}user-defined , declare a subclass of VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta , set prefix=\"%{\", suffix=\"}user-defined\". When AccessLogPatternParser parses \"%{VARNAME}user-defined\", it will extract the \"VARNAME\" as parameter to call AccessLogItemCreator , to create a AccessLogItem . VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta has a subclass CompositeVertxRestAccessLogItemMeta . When user needs to define multiple AccessLogItems, multiple VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta can be aggregated into CompositeVertxRestAccessLogItemMeta . When Parser loads AccessLogItemMeta of type CompositeVertxRestAccessLogItemMeta , it calls the meta class's getAccessLogItemMetas() method to get a set of AccessLogItemMeta. VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta is loaded by the SPI mechanism, and CompositeVertxRestAccessLogItemMeta allows user to load multiple meta infos with on one record in the SPI configuration file, which provides great flexibility. AccessLogItemCreator public interface AccessLogItemCreator<T> { // Receive configuration values and return an AccessLogItem. The method receives a null if there is no variables in AccessLogItem placeholder AccessLogItem<T> createItem(String config); } The user instantiates his AccessLogItem by setting the AccessLogItemCreator in the custom VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta. Since this is a functional interface, when the AccessLogItem is initialized in a simple way, you can directly define the Creator using a Lambda expression to simplify development. Matching rules of AccessLogItemMeta Once AccessLogItemMeta is loaded into the Parser, it will be sorted once. Parser will match the meta list from front to back when parsing the pattern string. The general matching rules are as follows: 1. Match metas with higher priority. 2. Match the meta with suffix first. When metas with multiple suffixes are matched, ~~take the one with the smallest suffix.~~ 3. Match the meta with a longer placeholder, for example, there are two metas, \"%abc\" and \"%a\". If \"%abc\" is matched, it will return directly. Sample Extend AccessLogItem First, the user needs the AccessLogItem interface to implement their own item: public class UserDefinedAccessLogItem implements AccessLogItem<RoutingContext> { private String config; public UserDefinedAccessLogItem(String config) { this.config = config; } @Override public String getFormattedItem(AccessLogParam<RoutingContext> accessLogParam) { // Here is the user's custom logic, user needs to take relevant data from AccessLogParam or other places, generate and return access log fragments return \"user-defined-[\" + config + \"]-[\" + accessLogParam.getStartMillisecond() + \"]\"; } } Define AccessLogItem meta class Inherit the class VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta or CompositeVertxRestAccessLogItemMeta , define the prefix and suffix of the AccessLogItem: public class UserDefinedCompositeExtendedAccessLogItemMeta extends CompositeVertxRestAccessLogItemMeta { private static final List<VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta> META_LIST = new ArrayList<>(); static { META_LIST.add(new VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta(\"%{\", \"}user-defined\", UserDefinedAccessLogItem::new)); } @Override public List<VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta> getAccessLogItemMetas() { return META_LIST; } } Configure the SPI load file In the resources/META-INF/services/ directory, create a file named \"org.apache.servicecomb.transport.rest.vertx.accesslog.parser.VertxRestAccessLogItemMeta\" and fill in the full class path of the meta class defined in the previous step. Parser will use this file to load the meta class. Configure Access Log pattern The configuration pattern in the microservice.yaml file is assumed to be \"%{test-config}user-defined\". The running service triggers the Access Log to print. If the request start time is 1, Access Log will print \"user- Defined-[test-config]-[1]\".

Contract first In this scenario, instead of using the contract automatically generated by the framework, the contract file provided by the developer is directly used, which requires the developer to ensure the consistency of the contract and the code. Scenario The service contract is used for decoupling between the server and the consumer. The server implements the service around the contract. The consumer invokes the service according to the contract, which can support the server and the consumer to implement in different programming languages. Description: The service provider registers the interface contract with the service center at startup, which can be downloaded and used by the service consumer. The interface contract is micro-service-version level information. When multiple micro-service instances are started, if an instance registers the contract with the service center, the service center will not overwrite the existing contract with the contract information registered by the latecomer. Therefore, only modifying the service provider's interface information will not change the contract stored by the service center. For the service consumer, the acquired interface information is still old. To update the interface contract in the service center, you can choose to upgrade the microservice version number or delete existing microservice information (the latter is not recommended for use in a production environment). Configuration ServiceComb defines API in a .yaml file. It's recommended to use Swagger Editor to define the APIs. This tool can check syntax and automaticlly generate an API document.

JAX-RS is used to describe the development of service code. The implementation of the Hello service is as follows: ```java import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.Produces; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType; import org.apache.servicecomb.samples.common.schema.models.Person; @Path(\"/jaxrshello\") @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) public class JaxrsHelloImpl { @Path(\"/sayhi\") @POST public String sayHi(String name) { \u3000return \"Hello \" + name; } @Path(\"/sayhello\") @POST public String sayHello(Person person) { return \"Hello person \" + person.getName(); } } ``` Note: PLEASE MAKE SURE TO MARK @Path ON YOUR PRODUCER(JaxrsHelloImpl), OR THE PATH AND METHOD OF PUBLISHED WILL BE INCORRECT!

Step 3 Release the service. Add @RestSchema as the annotation of the service implementation class and specify schemaID, which indicates that the implementation is released as a schema of the current microservice. The code is as follows: java import org.apache.servicecomb.provider.rest.common.RestSchema; // other code omitted @RestSchema(schemaId = \"jaxrsHello\") public class JaxrsHelloImpl implements Hello { // other code omitted } Create the jaxrsHello.bean.xml file in the resources/META-INF/spring directory and configure base-package that performs scanning.

Users can use annotations to add descriptions of contracts to their code. ServiceComb supports part of these annotations. Scene Description By using annotations to describe interface contracts, users can use ServiceComb's Swagger contract generation function to automatically generate contract documents that meet the requirements without having to manually write and modify contracts, which can effectively improve development efficiency. Configuration instructions The official description can be found in the [Swagger Annotation Document] (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X). You can refer to the official documentation and this guide to learn how to use annotations to specify the properties of a Swagger contract under the ServiceComb framework. In ServiceComb, Swagger annotations are not required. When a user uses SpringMVC and JAX-RS annotations to annotate microservice methods, ServiceComb can infer the contract information for each microservice method based on the values \u200b\u200bof these annotations. @Api @Api acts at the class level and is used to mark a Class as a Swagger resource in the official Swagger description. However, this annotation is not required in ServiceComb. ServiceComb can determine which classes need to parse the Swagger contract based on @RestSchema and @RpcSchema . Attribute Type Description Tags string set the default tag value of the operation defined under the current Class consumes string specify the MIME types of request in schema level, separated by commas produces string specify the MIME types of response in schema level, separated by commas @SwaggerDefinition Acts at the class level to define information in a Swagger resource.

Note : ServiceComb can automatically infer parameter names based on code and SpringMVC, JAX-RS annotations. If the parameter name of the @ApiImplicitParam configuration is different from the automatically inferred parameter name, then the parameter of the annotation configuration will be added as a new parameter to the operation in which the annotation is located; otherwise, the property of the parameter with the same name will be overwritten.

There are three key concepts in fallback: isolation, circuit breaking, and fault tolerance: Isolation is an exception detection mechanism. There are two common \"exception\"s: timeout and overload, which can be controlled by timeout duration and max concurrent requests. Circuit breaking is an exception response mechanism which depends on isolation. Circuit breaking is triggered by the error rate, like the number of bad requests, or the rate of invalid calls. Fault tolerance is an exception handling mechanism that depends on circuit breaking. Fault tolerance is called after a circuit breaking is triggered. Users can set the number of fault tolerance calls in the configuration. Let's combine the 3 concepts: the isolation mechanism detects there are M(the threshold) errors in N requests, the circuit breaking is triggered and make sure there are no more requests sent, and then fault tolerance method is called. Technically the concept definition is the same with Netflix Hystrix, making it easy to understand the config items(Reference: Hystrix Configuration ). ServiceComb provides 2 fault tolerance methods: returning null values and throwing exceptions. Scenario Users configure a fallback policy to handle microservices' exceptions.

ServiceComb provides the implementation class for service calling Develop consumer with AsyncRestTemplate AsyncRestTemplate allows users to make asynchronous service calls. The logic is similar to restTemplate, except that the service is called asynchronously. Develop consumer with transparent RPC The transparent RPC allows users to make service calls like a local call through a simple java interface. Using Contracts When a consumer calls a service from a provider, the contract is required. The consumer can get the providers' contracts in 2 ways: get the providers' contract from off-line, then manually configure it in the project. Or, download the contract from the service center. Call Control Instance level fault isolation The instance-level fault isolation feature introduces the ability to isolate failed service instances by stopping sending request to them.

The usage Micro Service Call Chain The microservices architecture solves the problems of many single applications, but it also requires us to pay extra. Request processing latency due to network instability is one of the costs. In a single application, all modules run in the same process, so there is no inter-module interworking problem. However, in the micro-service architecture, services communicate through the network, so we have to deal with network-related issues such as delays, timeouts, network partitions, and so on. In addition, as the business expands its services, it is difficult to see how data flows through a spider-like complex service structure. How can we effectively monitor network latency and visualize data flow in services? Distributed call chain tracking is used to effectively monitor network latency for microservices and visualize data flow in microservices. Custom call chain management Distributed call chain tracking provides timing information for calls between services, but the link call information inside the service is equally important to the developer. If you can combine the two into one, you can provide a more complete call chain, which is easier to locate. Errors and potential performance issues. Local development and testing This section describes how to develop and debug consumer/provider applications locally on the developer side. For development service providers, please refer to the section 3 Development Service Providers. For development service consumers, please refer to 4 Development Service Consumers. Both the service provider and the consumer provider need to connect to the remote service center. For the development and debugging of local microservices, this section describes two ways to set up a local service center for local microservices debugging: Http Filter In some scenarios, the service uses http instead of https as the network transmission channel. In order to prevent the falsification or tampering request, the signature function of the http code stream between the consumer and the producer needs to be provided. File Upload File upload, currently supported in vertx rest channel and servlet rest. File uploads use the standard http form format, which interfaces directly with the browser's upload. Download Document File downloads are currently available in the vertx rest channel and servlet rest. Reactive Comparison and description between simple synchronization mode, nested synchronous call, pure Reactive mechanism, and hybrid Reactive mechanism. DNS Custom Configuration When a user uses a domain name to connect to a Huawei public cloud or a three-party system, you need to use the domain name resolution system. The domain name resolution mechanisms used in different systems and different frameworks may be different. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a unified configuration entry so that development and operation personnel can customize the DNS resolution mechanism without being completely subject to system configuration. Proxy settings As a developer, in a company development environment, it is possible to access the Internet through a corporate agent network. If you must also rely on online resources when debugging services, such as directly connecting to Huawei's shared cloud service center, you must configure the agent. Frame report version number In order to facilitate the management, using ServiceComb for development, the currently used ServiceComb version number will be reported to the service center, and the version number of other frameworks will be reported when other frameworks integrate ServiceComb. Cross-application call An application is a layer in the microservice instance isolation hierarchy, and an application contains multiple microservices. By default, only microservice instances of the same application are allowed to call each other. Custom Serialization and Deserialization Methods Due to the non-security of the HTTP protocol, data transmitted over the network can be easily monitored by various packet capture tools. In practical applications, services have high security requirements for sensitive data transmitted between applications or services. Such data requires special encryption protection (different services have different algorithm requirements), so that even if the content is intercepted, it can protect Sensitive data is not easily obtained. Using Context to pass control messages ServiceComb provides a Context to pass data between microservices. Context is a key/value pair and can only use data of type String. Since the Context is serialized into the json format and passed through the HTTP header, characters other than ASCII are not supported. Other characters require the developer to encode and pass the code. The Context is passed on the request chain in a single request and does not need to be reset. Functions such as the trace id of the access log are implemented based on this feature. return value serialization extension The current REST channel return value supports both application/json and text/plain formats, supports developer extensions and rewrites, service providers provide serialization capabilities through producer declarations, and service consumers specify return value serialization through the request's Accept header. By default, the data in application/json format is returned. CORS mechanism Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows Web servers to perform cross-domain access control, enabling browsers to more securely transfer data across domains. Obtaining the fuse and instance isolation alarm event information When the microservice is running or the instance isolation status changes, you need to listen to related events, get relevant information and process it.","title":"General develop"},{"location":"catalog/general-develop/#access-service-center","text":"The system realizes the discovery between services through the service center.

As the external interface of the entire microservice system, the Edge Service provides services to end users, accesses RESTful requests, and forwards them to internal microservices. The Edge Service is provided in the form of a development framework. Developers can easily build an Edge Service service and define routing and forwarding rules with a simple configuration. At the same time, Edge Service supports powerful expansion capabilities, and services such as service mapping, request parsing, encryption and decryption, and authentication can be extended. The Edge Service itself is also a microservice that is subject to all microservice development rules. It can be deployed as a multi-instance, and the front-end uses a load balancing device for load distribution. It can also be deployed as a master and backup, and directly access user requests. Developers can plan according to the logic and service access and networking conditions carried by the Edge Service. Developing Edge Service Developing Edge Service is similar to developing a normal microservice. Developers can import [ServiceComb Edge Service Demo] (https://github.com/apache/incubator-servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/demo/demo -edge) Start. Building a project from scratch involves the following steps: Configure dependencies By adding edge-core dependencies to your project, you can start the Edge Service. When the Edge Service requests forwarding, it will go through the processing chain, so it can also join the dependencies of the relevant processing chain modules. The following example adds the load balancing processing chain. This is a must. <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>edge-core</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>handler-loadbalance</artifactId> </dependency> Define the startup class Just like developing a normal microservice, you can pull the service by loading Spring. public class EdgeMain { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { Log4jUtils.init(); BeanUtils.init(); } } Increase the configuration file microservie.yaml The Edge Service itself is also a microservice that follows the rules of microservice lookup and will register itself. Note that APPLICAIONT_ID is the same as the microservice that needs to be forwarded. In the following configuration, the address that the Edge Service listens to, the processing chain, and so on are specified. The auth processing chain is a custom processing chain in the DEMO project for implementing authentication. At the same time, the auth service itself, without going through this processing chain, is equivalent to not authenticating. APPLICATION_ID: edge service_description: name: edge version: 0.0.1 servicecomb: service: registry: address: http://127.0.0.1:30100 rest: address: 127.0.0.1:18080 handler: chain: Consumer: default: auth,loadbalance service: auth: loadbalance work process The workflow of the Edge Service is as follows, the blue background part is executed in the Eventloop thread, and the yellow background part: * If working in reactive mode, execute directly in the Eventloop thread * If working in thread pool mode, execute in the thread pool thread Custom routing rules The core job of using the Edge Service is to configure routing rules. The rules are different, and the rules are different. A routing rule consists of a series of AbstractEdgeDispatchers. The Edge Service provides several common Dispatchers that can be enabled through configuration. If these Dispatchers do not meet the needs of the business scenario, they can be customized. Using DefaultEdgeDispatcher DefaultEdgeDispatcher is a very simple and easy to manage Dispatcher. With this Dispatcher, users do not need to manage forwarding rules dynamically. It is very convenient to apply to actual business scenarios. This is also a recommended management mechanism. It contains the following configuration items: servicecomb: http: dispatcher: edge: default: enabled: true prefix: rest withVersion: true prefixSegmentCount: 1 Examples and meanings of these common configuration items are as follows: * [prefix=rest;withVersion=true;prefixSegmentCount=1] The URL provided by the microservice xService is: /xService/v1/abc, the address accessed by the Edge is /rest/xService/v1/abc, and the request is only forwarded to [1.0 .0-2.0.0) version of the microservice instance. * [prefix=rest;withVersion=true;prefixSegmentCount=2] The URL provided by the microservice xService is: /v1/abc, the address accessed by the Edge is /rest/xService/v1/abc, and the request is only forwarded to [1.0.0] -2.0.0) version of the microservice instance. * [prefix=rest;withVersion=true;prefixSegmentCount=3] The URL provided by the microservice xService is: /abc, the address accessed by Edge is /rest/xService/v1/abc, and the request is forwarded only to [1.0.0-2.0] .0) version of the microservice instance. * [prefix=rest;withVersion=false;prefixSegmentCount=1] The URL provided by the microservice xService is: /xService/v1/abc, the address accessed by the Edge is /rest/xService/v1/abc, and the request may be forwarded to any micro Service instance. * [prefix=rest;withVersion=false;prefixSegmentCount=2] The URL provided by the microservice xService is: /v1/abc, the address accessed by Edge is /rest/xService/v1/abc, and the request may be forwarded to any microservice. Example. * [prefix=rest;withVersion=false;prefixSegmentCount=2] The URL provided by the microservice xService is: /abc, the address accessed by the Edge is /rest/xService/abc, and the request may be forwarded to any microservice instance. The withVersion configuration item provides a client grayscale rule that allows the client to specify which server version to access. The Edge Service also includes the ability to route based on interface compatibility automatically, and requests are forwarded to instances that contain the interface. Assume that a microservice, compatibility plan for all high versions must be compatible with the lower version, deploy the following version of the instance: 1.0.0, provides operation1 1.1.0, provided operation1, operation2 When Edge Service forwards operation1, it automatically uses the rule of 1.0.0+ to filter the instance. When Edge Service forwards operation2, it automatically uses the rules of 1.1.0+ to filter instances. The above process does not require any intervention and is fully automated to avoid forwarding the new version of the operation to the instance of the old version. Using URLMappedEdgeDispatcher URLMappedEdgeDispatcher allows users to configure mappings between URLs and microservices. It is very flexible to define which URLs are forwarded to which microservices. It contains the following configuration items: servicecomb: http: dispatcher: edge: url: enabled: true mappings: businessV1: prefixSegmentCount: 1 path: \"/url/business/v1/.*\" microserviceName: business versionRule: 1.0.0-2.0.0 businessV2: prefixSegmentCount: 1 path: \"/url/business/v2/.*\" microserviceName: business versionRule: 2.0.0-3.0.0 The meaning of the businessV1 configuration item is that the request with the request path of /usr/business/v1/. is forwarded to the microservice of business and only forwarded to the instance with version number 1.0.0-2.0.0 (excluding 2.0). .0). The URL when forwarding is /business/v1/. . Path uses the JDK regular expression, and you can view the description of the Pattern class. prefixSegmentCount indicates the number of URL segments of the prefix, and the prefix is not included in the forwarded URL path. Three forms of versionRule can be specified. 2.0.0-3.0.0 indicates the version range, including 2.0.0, but does not contain 3.0.0; 2.0.0+ indicates a version greater than 2.0.0, including 2.0.0; 2.0.0 means forwarding only to 2.0.0 version. 2, 2.0 is equivalent to 2.0.0. As can be seen from the above configuration, URLMappedEdgeDispatcher also supports client grayscale. Of course, there will be more configuration items than DefaultEdgeDispatcher. The URLMappedEdgeDispatcher supports dynamic configuration modification of the configuration center to adjust routing rules. Custom Dispatcher Customizing the Dispatcher involves two steps: Implement AbstractEdgeDispatcher Release via SPI: add the file META-INF/services/org.apache.servicecomb.transport.rest.vertx.VertxHttpDispatcher and write the implementation class Detailed code details can be found in the following section \"DEMO Functional Description\". Developers can also refer to the Code such as DefaultEdgeDispatcher to define their Dispatcher. Perform authentication and other business processing Through the Edge Service workflow, you can see that the Edge Service features can be extended in a variety of ways, including Dispatcher, HttpServerFilter, Handler, HttpClientFilter, and more. More common and straightforward is to extend through Handler. DEMO shows how to implement authentication through Handler extensions. Detailed code details can be found in the following section \"DEMO Functional Description\". Deployment example Operating mode reactive (default) The Edge Service works by default in the high-performance reactive mode. This mode requires that the business code working in the Edge Service forwarding process cannot have any blocking operations, including: Remote synchronization calls, such as an asynchronous query database, synchronous call microservices, or synchronous query remote cache, etc. any sleep call any wait call Oversized loop The underlying Edge Service is based on netty's vertx. The above constraint is netty's reactive mode constraint. Thread Pool If the business model cannot meet the reactive requirements, you need to use the thread pool mode. In this case, you need to configure it in the microservice.yaml of the Edge Service: servicecomb: executors: default: servicecomb.executor.groupThreadPool Here servicecomb.executor.groupThreadPool is the beanId of the spring bean corresponding to the default thread pool built into ServiceComb; the service can customize its thread pool and declare it as a bean whose beanId can also be configured here. DEMO Function Description Please refer to the edge service demo on GitHub: https://github.com/ServiceComb/ServiceComb-Java-Chassis/tree/master/demo/demo-edge The demo contains the following projects: authentication: microservice: authentication server edge-service hiboard-business-1.0.0 microservices: business, version 1.0.0, operation add hiboard-business-1.1.0 microservices: business, version 1.1.0, operation add/dec hiboard-business-2.0.0 microservices: business, version 2.0.0, operation add/dec hiboard-consumer as a normal httpclient, not a servicecomb consumer hiboard-model non-micro service, just some public models Access different versions of microservices through edge-service and confirm that the correct instance handles them. 1.Register Dispatcher Implement the interface org.apache.servicecomb.transport.rest.vertx.VertxHttpDispatcher, or inherit from org.apache.servicecomb.edge.core.AbstractEdgeDispatcher to implement your own dispatcher function. The implementation class is registered to the system through the Java standard SPI mechanism. Dispatcher needs to implement 2 methods: getOrder Dispatcher needs to inject routing rules into vertx, and routing rules have a priority order relationship. All Dispatchers in the system are sorted according to the return value of getOrder from small to large and initialized in order. If the GetOrder return values the two Dispatchers are the same, the order of the two is unpredictable. init The init method is included in the io.vertx.ext.web.The router in the vertx framework. You need to customize the routing rules through this object. You can specify the url that meets the requirements, whether you need to process the cookie, whether you need to handle the body, which custom method to use to process the received request, etc. For more details on routing rules, please refer to the official vertx documentation: [vertx routing mechanism] (http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_routing_by_exact_path) prompt: _ Multiple Dispatchers can set routing rules to cover the same url. _ _Assuming Dispatcher A and B can both handle the same url, and A has a higher priority, then: _ _ If A is processed, neither responding nor calling RoutingContext.next(), it is a bug, this request is hanged _ _ If A is processed and then calling RoutingContext.next(), the request will be transferred to B. 2. Forwarding request When registering a route, it specifies which method is used to process the request (the following method is used to refer to the method), and the forwarding logic is implemented in the onRequest. The method prototype is: void onRequest(RoutingContext context) The system encapsulates org.apache.servicecomb.edge.core.EdgeInvocation to implement forwarding. At least the following parameters need to be prepared: microserviceName, the business makes its own rules, can be passed in the url, or according to the url search, etc. context, that is, the input of onRequest path, the url of the forwarding target httpServerFilters, the Dispatcher parent class has initialized member variables EdgeInvocation edgeInvocation = new EdgeInvocation(); edgeInvocation.init(microserviceName, context, path, httpServerFilters); edgeInvocation.edgeInvoke(); The edgeInvoke call is internally called and will be forwarded as a ServiceComb standard consumer. As a standard consumer, it means that the governance capabilities of all ServiceComb standards are valid here. 3. Setting compatibility rules Different services may have different compatibility plans, servicecomb default compatibility rules, and all new versions are required to be compatible with the old version. If this requirement is met, no special settings need to be made. There is also a typical plan: 1.0.0-2.0.0 is internally compatible, url is in the form of /microserviceName/v1/.... 2.0.0-3.0.0 is internally compatible, url is in the form of /microserviceName/v2/.... ...... Incompatible between major versions At this point, the developer needs to set compatibility rules for EdgeInvocation: private CompatiblePathVersionMapper versionMapper = new CompatiblePathVersionMapper(); \u2026\u2026 edgeInvocation.setVersionRule(versionMapper.getOrCreate(pathVersion).getVersionRule()); The role of versionMapper is to convert a string such as v1 or v2 to a compatibility rule such as 1.0.0-2.0.0 or 2.0.0-3.0.0. note: Incompatible interfaces can cause many problems. The java chassis requires that the higher version of the service is compatible with the lower version of the service, and only allows the addition of the interface to not allow the interface to be deleted. After adding an interface, you must increase the version number of the microservice. In the development phase, interfaces change frequently, and developers often forget this rule. When this constraint is broken, you need to clean up the service center microservices information and restart the microservices and Edge Service\\ (and other services that depend on the microservices). Otherwise, the request forwarding failure may occur. 4.Authentication The Edge Service is the boundary of the system and requires authentication logic for many requests. Based on the standard ServiceComb mechanism, this function can be implemented by the handler. The simplest code is as follows: public class AuthHandler implements Handler { private Auth auth; public AuthHandler() { auth = Invoker.createProxy(\"auth\", \"auth\", Auth.class); } \u2026\u2026 @Override public void handle(Invocation invocation, AsyncResponse asyncResp) throws Exception { if (!auth.auth(\"\")) { asyncResp.consumerFail(new InvocationException(Status.UNAUTHORIZED, (Object) \"auth failed\")); return; } LOGGER.debug(\"auth success.\"); invocation.next(asyncResp); } } Auth is the interface provided by the authentication microservice. Invoker.createProxy(\"auth\", \"auth\", Auth.class) is the underlying api of the consumer in the transparent RPC development mode, which is equivalent to @ReferenceRpc, but not Need to rely on the spring bean mechanism. The business completely defines the Auth interface, but here is just an example. After the Handler development is complete, configure it into the microservice.yaml of the edge service: servicecomb: handler: chain: Consumer: default: auth,\u2026\u2026 service: auth: \u2026\u2026 In this example, it means that the forwarding request to all microservices must be authenticated, but authentication is not required when calling the authentication microservice.","title":"Using Edge Service"},{"location":"edge/by-servicecomb-sdk/#using-edge-service-for-edge-services","text":"Edge Service is the JAVA gateway service development framework provided by ServiceComb.

If you can combine the two into one, you can provide a more complete call chain, which is easier to locate. Errors and potential performance issues. Prerequisites Using the custom dot function requires first configuring and enabling the Java Chassis microservice call chain. Precautions The custom dot function using the @Span annotation only supports method calls that are requesting the same thread as the Java Chassis call. The method to add the @Span annotation must be a Spring-managed bean, otherwise you need to press the [Methods mentioned] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41383941/load-time-weaving-for-non-spring -beans-in-a-spring-application) configuration. Custom call chain management This feature integrates Zipkin and provides the @Span annotation for custom tracking of methods that need to be tracked. Java Chassis will automatically track all methods that add @Span annotations, linking the local call information of each method to the call information between services. Steps for usage: Adding dependencies Microservices based on ServiceComb Java Chassis only need to add the following dependency to pom.xml: <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>tracing-zipkin</artifactId> </dependency> Enable custom management function {#Configure tracking processing and data collection} Add the @EnableZipkinTracing annotation to the application portal or Spring configuration class: @SpringBootApplication @EnableZipkinTracing public class ZipkinSpanTestApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(ZipkinSpanTestApplication.class); } } Customized management Add the @Span annotation to the method that requires custom management: @Component public class SlowRepoImpl implements SlowRepo { private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SlowRepoImpl.class); private final Random random = new Random(); @Span @Override public String crawl() throws InterruptedException { logger.info(\"in /crawl\"); Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(200)); return \"crawled\"; } } In this way, by using the @Span annotation, we started the Zipkin-based custom management function. Customized reported data The call chain that is escalated by custom management contains two pieces of data: span name defaults to the full name of the method currently being annotated. call.path defaults to the method signature of the current annotation. For example, the data reported in the above example SlowRepoImp is as follows: key value span name crawl call.path public abstract java.lang.String org.apache.servicecomb.tests.tracing.SlowRepo.crawl() throws java.lang.InterruptedException If you need to customize the reported data content, you can pass in the custom parameters: public static class CustomSpanTask { @Span(spanName = \"transaction1\", callPath = \"startA\") public String invoke() { return \"invoke the method\"; } }","title":"Customized-Tracing"},{"location":"general-development/customized-tracing/#concept-description","text":"Distributed call chain tracking provides timing information for calls between services, but the link call information inside the service is equally important to the developer.

Customize exceptions type We can define actual types for error code and convert one type of exception to another. define actual types for error code Define actual types for error code can make consumer code easier, and do not to use raw types. Users can implement a SPI interface org.apache.servicecomb.swagger.invocation.response.ResponseMetaMapper to specify the target exception type for specific error code. ```java private final static Map CODES = new HashMap<>(1); static { ResponseMeta meta = new ResponseMeta(); meta.setJavaType(SimpleType.constructUnsafe(IllegalStateErrorData.class)); CODES.put(500, meta); } @Override public Map<Integer, ResponseMeta> getMapper() { return CODES; } ``` convert one type of exception to another ServiceComb will serialize InvocationException data to response, and when the exception type is not InvocationException , a wrapped InvocationException with error code 490, 590 is created. Implement SPI interface org.apache.servicecomb.swagger.invocation.exception.ExceptionToProducerResponseConverter can convert one type of exception to another. Here is the description about ExceptionToProducerResponseConverter : - the method getExceptionClass() indicates which type of exception this converter handles. The converter whose getExceptionClass() method returns null will be taken as default converter. - in the method Response convert(SwaggerInvocation swaggerInvocation, T e) , the exception is processed and Response is returned. The returned Response determines the status code, resposne body of the HTTP response. - the method getOrder() determines the priority of a converter. The less the returned value is, the higher the priority is. If the converter does not implement this method, the default return value is 0 . For a certain type of exception, only the converter with the highest priority will take effect. - When an exception comes, the converters will be selected according to its type. If no converter is selected, then the type of its parent class is used to select the converter. Such process will continue until the Throwable type is used to select converter. If there is still no converter for this exception, the default converter will be selected to process this type of exception. ```java public class CustomExceptionToProducerResponseConverter implements ExceptionToProducerResponseConverter { @Override public Class getExceptionClass() { // The return value indicates that this converter handles IllegalStateException return IllegalStateException.class; } @Override public int getOrder() { // The less the returned value is, the higher the priority is return 100; } @Override public Response convert(SwaggerInvocation swaggerInvocation, IllegalStateException e) { // Here the exception is processed IllegalStateErrorData data = new IllegalStateErrorData(); data.setId(500); data.setMessage(e.getMessage()); data.setState(e.getMessage()); InvocationException state = new InvocationException(Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, data); return Response.failResp(state); } } ```","title":"Handling exceptions"},{"location":"general-development/error-handling/#handle-exceptions","text":"ServiceComb has three categories of exceptions\uff1a * User Defined Exceptions\uff1aExceptions defined in API.

To prevent the falsification or tampering request, consumer and the producer must be provided a method to signature the http stream. The signature method is carried using the org.apache.servicecomb.common.rest.filter.HttpClientFilter and org.apache.servicecomb.common.rest.filter.HttpServerFilter interfaces. It is recommended that the http stream related logic use the Filter mechanism here, and the contract The parameter related logic uses the Handler mechanism. About the use of the Filter interface, please reference [demo-signature] (https://github.com/ServiceComb/ServiceComb-Java-Chassis/tree/master/demo/demo-signature). 1 Overview The Filter mechanism is loaded using the Java standard SPI mechanism. Both HttpClientFilter and HttpServerFilter allow multiple loads: The order of execution between instances is determined by the return value of getOrder If getOrder returns the same value, the corresponding instance order is randomly determined Whether it is request or response, read the body stream, use getBodyBytes\\ (), the return value may be null (such as scenario of getting an invocation), if not null, the corresponding stream length, Obtain through getBodyBytesLength\\ (\\ ). Tips : The beforeSendRequest of HttpClientFilter is executed in the current thread of the interface call, and the afterReceiveResponse is executed in the business thread pool. The afterReceiveRequest of HttpServerFilter is executed in the business thread pool, beforeSendResponse and beforeSendResponseAsync may be executed in the business thread pool or the network thread pool. Make sure that blocking operations can not occur. The bottom layer of Java Chassis is an asynchronous framework, with frequent thread switching. When the business extends Filter, if it involves obtaining the thread context through ThreadLocal, the acquisition may be empty. For this scenario, it is recommended to use InhritableThreadLocal instead of ThreadLocal to store data, or to use extended Handler instead of Filter. 2.HttpClientFilter The system has two built-in HttpClientFilter. Note that the order value does not conflict when extending the function: org.apache.servicecomb.provider.springmvc.reference.RestTemplateCopyHeaderFilter, order value is Integer.MIN_VALUE org.apache.servicecomb.transport.rest.client.http.DefaultHttpClientFilter, order value is Integer.MAX_VALUE 2.1 Prototype public interface HttpClientFilter { int getOrder(); void beforeSendRequest(Invocation invocation, HttpServletRequestEx requestEx); // if finished, then return a none null response // if return a null response, then sdk will call next filter.afterReceive Response afterReceiveResponse(Invocation invocation, HttpServletResponseEx responseEx); } 2.2 beforeSendRequest Used to send a request after the stream has been generated calculate the signature based on url, header, query, and stream then set to the header \\ (requestEx.setHeader). From the invocation, you can get the various metadata and the object parameters of this call (the stream is generated according to these parameters). 2.3 afterReceiveResponse Used to calculate the signature according to the header and the stream after receiving the response from the network, and compare it with the signature in the header. If the signature is incorrect, directly construct a Response. As a return value, the framework will interrupt calls to other HttpClientFilters as long as it does not return NULL. 3 HttpServerFilter 3.1 Prototype public interface HttpServerFilter { int getOrder(); default boolean needCacheRequest(OperationMeta operationMeta) { return false; } // if finished, then return a none null response // if return a null response, then sdk will call next filter.afterReceiveRequest Response afterReceiveRequest(Invocation invocation, HttpServletRequestEx requestEx); // invocation maybe null void beforeSendResponse(Invocation invocation, HttpServletResponseEx responseEx); } 3.2 needCacheRequest Unlike HttpClientFilter, the ability to decide whether to cache requests is added. This is because ServiceComb can not only run in standalone mode but also run in web container (such as Tomcat). In the implementation of a servlet, request stream can only be read once, and does not necessarily support reset (such as Tomcat), RESTful The framework needs to perform deserialization. It needs to read the body stream. The signature logic also needs to read the body stream. If the default processing is used, one of the functions cannot be implemented. So when running in a web container scenario, all HttpServerFilters, as long as there is a return request that needs to be cached, the body stream will be copied and saved to support repeated reads. The input parameter is the metadata corresponding to the request, and the service can decide whether the cache request is needed for the request. 3.3 afterReceiveRequest After receiving the request, the signature is calculated according to the URL, header, query, and code stream, and compared with the signature in the header. If the signature is incorrect, a Response is directly constructed as the return value. As long as the NULL is not returned, the framework will interrupt the other HttpClientFilter Call. 3.4 beforeSendResponse Before sending a response, the signature is calculated according to the header and the stream and set to the header.

So when running in a web container scenario, all HttpServerFilters, as long as there is a return request that needs to be cached, the body stream will be copied and saved to support repeated reads. The input parameter is the metadata corresponding to the request, and the service can decide whether the cache request is needed for the request.","title":"3.2 needCacheRequest"},{"location":"general-development/http-filter/#33-afterreceiverequest","text":"After receiving the request, the signature is calculated according to the URL, header, query, and code stream, and compared with the signature in the header.

Both service providers and consumers need to connect to the remote service center. Two methods of building Local ServiceCenter for local microservice commissioning are as follows: Starting Local Service Center . Starting Local Service Center Mock mechanism . Local debugging by setting up environmental information The Service Center is an important component in the microservice architecture, this is used in managing and handle: registering and discovering, for service metadata and service instance metadata. The logic relationship between the service center and microservice provider/consumer is as follows: Starting Local ServiceCenter Step 1 Starting local service center run in executable files Windows Linux (1) Download the [Service Registry Executable Compressor] (http://apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/servicecomb/incubator-servicecomb-service-center/1.0.0-m1/apache-servicecomb- Incubating-service-center-1.0.0-m1-windows-amd64.tar.gz) (2) Extract to the current folder (3) Go to the unzipped directory and double-click to run the **start-service-center.bat** file. 1) Download the Service Registry executable file archive and extract it ```bash wget http://apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/servicecomb/incubator-servicecomb-service-center/1.0.0-m1/apache-servicecomb-incubating-service-center-1.0.0-m1-linux-amd64.tar.gz tar xvf apache-servicecomb-incubating-service-center-1.0.0-m1-linux-amd64.tar.gz ``` 2) Run the service registry ```bash Bash apache-servicecomb-incubating-service-center-1.0.0-m1-linux-amd64/start-service-center.sh ``` Note: The frontend (frontend) will be bound to the ipv6 address by default in the Linux environment, causing the browser to report an error. The repair method is: first modify the httpaddr in conf/app.conf to the external reachable network card ip, and then modify the app/appList/apiList. .js `ip : 'http://127.0.0.1'` for the corresponding ip, and finally restart ServiceCenter. Note: Both Windows and Linux versions only support 64-bit systems. Run as Docker bash Docker pull servicecomb/service-center Docker run -d -p 30100:30100 servicecomb/service-center:latest Step 2 After starting the local service center, configure the ServerCenter address and port in the service provider/consumer's microservice.yaml file. Example code: yaml Servicecomb: Service: Registry: Address: #Service Center address and port Http://127.0.0.1:30100 Step 3 Development service provider/consumer, launch microservices for local testing. ----End Mock mechanism start service center Simulate a service center that can only be used by this process in the process memory, which is generally used in the test scenario. * ### In-process call Just declare it before starting the ServiceComb engine to enable it: System.setProperty(\"local.registry.file\", \"notExistJustForceLocal\"); Cross-process call If the deployment is simple and the deployment information is static, you can use this mock mechanism even if you have a cross-process call. The producer end is still declared like \"in-process call\" However, because the Mock does not work across processes, the Mock on the consumer side needs to provide a local configuration file that describes the details of the call target, including the name, version, address, schema id, etc. Similarly, because the Mock cannot cross processes, the consumer cannot dynamically obtain the contract information of the producer. Therefore, the contract file needs to be provided locally. (This scenario, using the Mock Service Center, is much more costly than using a standalone service center, not recommended) Step 1 Create a new local service center definition file, assuming the name is registry.yaml, the content example is as follows: Step 1 Create a new local service center definition file, assuming the name is registry.yaml, the content example is as follows: yaml localserv: - id: \"100\" version: \"0.0.1\" appid: localservreg schemaIds: - hello instances: - endpoints: - rest://localhost:8080 - highway://localhost:7070 * Step 2 consumer local deployment contract file Reference: [Define Service Contract] (https://docs.servicecomb.io/java-chassis/zh_CN/build-provider/define-contract.html) * Step 3 In the consumer main function, declare the ServiceComb engine before starting: java \u3000\u3000System.setProperty(\"local.registry.file\", \"/path/registry.yaml\"); The second parameter of setProperty fills in the absolute path of the registry.yaml system on the disk, pay attention to distinguish the corresponding path separator in different systems. Local debugging by setting environment information The java chassis is strictly dependent on the contract when designing, so usually the version of the microservice has to change when the contract updated. However, if the development mode is still in progress, it is normal to modify the interface. If you need to change the version every time, it is very unfriendly to the user, so an environment setting is added for this case. If the microservice is configured as a development environment, the interface is modified (the schema has changed), and the restart can be registered to the service center without modifying the version number. However, if consumer client has already called the service before the restart, the consumer client needs to be restarted to get the latest schema. For example, A -> B, B interface has been modified and restarted, then A is still using B last schema at this time, the call may be wrong, so as to avoid unknown exceptions, A also needs to restart. There are three ways to set it up, Recommended method 1 Method 1: Set by the JVM startup parameter -Dservice_description.environment=development Method 2: Specify by microservice.yaml configuration file service_description: environment: development Method 3: Specify by environment variable (only for Windows system), such as the following settings under Eclipse","title":"Local development and testing"},{"location":"general-development/local-develop-test/#local-development-and-test","text":"","title":"Local Development and Test"},{"location":"general-development/local-develop-test/#concept-description","text":"This section describes how developers can locally develop and commission consumer and provider applications.

Request processing latency due to network instability is one of the costs. In a single application, all modules run in the same process, so there is no inter-module interworking problem. However, in the micro-service architecture, services communicate through the network, so we have to deal with network-related issues such as delays, timeouts, network partitions, and so on. Also, as the business expands its services, it is difficult to see how data flows through a spider-like complex service structure. How can we effectively monitor network latency and visualize data flow in services? Distributed Call Chain Tracking is used to monitor network latency for microservices effectively and visualize data flow in microservices. Zipkin [Zipkin] (http://zipkin.io/) is a distributed call chain tracking system. It helps users collect time series data to locate latency issues in microservices, and it also manages the collection and query of trace data.

ServiceComb provides hierarchical instance isolation. Microservices instance hierarchical management To understand the isolation level between instances, you first need to understand a well-established microservice system structure defined by ServiceComb: In the microservice system structure, the top layer is the \u201cproject\u201d, which is divided into multiple tenants under the project. The tenant contains multiple applications, and each application contains multiple environments, that is, the test and production environments can be separated. In a particular environment of a particular application, there are multiple microservices, and one microservice can have multiple versions at the same time. The above is the scope of all static metadata. A specific version of a particular service contains multiple microservice instances registered at runtime, because the information of the service instance is dynamic at runtime because of system scaling, failure, etc. The change, so the routing information of the service instance is again dynamic data. By hierarchically managing these data for microservices, this is natural to achieve logical isolation between instances. * Project corresponds to the project created under each region of Huawei cloud. Different projects are isolated from each other. If there is no new project under the region, it represents the region; for example, create a project named tianjing in North China (cn-north-1), if you want to register the microservice to the project, you can configure it in the microservice.yaml file\uff1a servicecomb: credentials: project: cn-north-1_tianjing Environment indicates the current environment of the microservice instance. You can configure the current instance environment through service_description.environment in the microservice.yaml file. Application represents a logical entity of a software application, representing a computer software application that has a business function presented to the user. The application name can be configured in the microservice.yaml file via the APPLICATION_ID. Service is a description of the functional objects that are accessed on demand. There are multiple services under one application, and each service calls each other. The service name can be specified in the microservice.yaml file by service_description.name. Version indicates the current service version. There may be multiple versions under one service. The current microservice version can be configured in the microservice.yaml file through service_description.version. When the consumer accesses, the default access is based on the routing rule, which can set by servicecomb.references.[providerName].version-rule in consumer. Typical scene Inter-application isolation and cross-application calls Function introduction In the ServiceComb framework, an application contains multiple microservices. The same microservice instance can be deployed as a public service to multiple applications by specifying a different APPLICATION_ID. Different microservice instances, by default, are only allowed to call each other in the same application. When users need to call microservices between different applications, they need to enable cross-application calling. Configuration instructions: To enable cross-application calls, you first need to enable cross-application call configuration in the microservice.yaml file on the provider side. The configuration items are as follows: service_description: properties: allowCrossApp: true When the Consumer side specifies the microservice name to call the provider, it needs to add the application ID to which the provider belongs. The format changes from [microserviceName] to [appID]:[microserviceName]. Code example: Assume that the application to which the consumer belongs is helloApp, the application to which the provider belongs is hellApp2, and the name of the microservice is helloProvider. * RestTemplate call mode When the consumer side develops the microservice consumer in the RestTemplate mode, you need to change [microserviceName] to [appID]:[microserviceName] in the called URL, as follows: RestTemplate restTemplate = RestTemplateBuilder.create(); ResponseEntity<String> responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity(\u201ccse://helloApp2:helloProvider/hello/sayHello?name={name}\u201d, String.class, \u201cServiceComb\u201d); RPC call mode When the consumer side develops a microservice consumer in RPC mode, the declared service provider proxy is as follows: @RpcReference(schemaId = \u201chello\u201d, microserviceName = \u201chelloApp2:helloProvider\u201d) private Hello hello; Cross-application calls are the same as calling microservices under the same application: hello.sayHello(\u201cServiceComb\u201d); Typical scene Development environment is isolated and rapidly developed Function introduction By setting the environment, the ServiceComb framework can mark microservice instances as development, testing, acceptance, and production environments, and achieve natural isolation at the instance level. When the client looks for a server instance, it can only find server instance under the same environment. ServiceComb is strictly dependent on the contract when designing, so under normal circumstances, the contract has changed, you must modify the version of the microservice. However, if current is still development mode, then modify the interface is a very normal situation, when the modification is completed and the current service is started again, the newly generated contract and the old contract saved on the Service Center will conflict and report an error, causing the startup to fail, It is obviously unfriendly to developers by modifying the microservice version number or by deleting the cached data of the service on the Service Center each time. The ServiceComb framework supports rapid debugging of microservices in the development state by configuring the environment as development. When the interface is modified (the schema has changed), restart can be registered to the service center without modifying the version number. But if a consumer has already called the service before the restart, then the consumer side needs to be restarted to get the schema of the latest provider; for example, A->B, the B interface has been modified and restarted, then A is still using B's previous schema, The call may be in error. to avoid an unknown exception and A needs to be restarted. Configuration instructions: Only the following enumerated values are supported: development, testing, acceptance, production. If not configured, the default value is \"\" (empty). Method 1: Set by the JVM startup parameter -Dservice_description.environment=development (enumeration value); Method 2: Specify by microservice.yaml configuration file: service_description: environment: development Method 3: Specify by environment variable SERVICECOMB_ENV (only for windows system), if it is development state, its value is configured as development; Typical scene Three centers in two places Function introduction In the scenario of deploying services across regions in a three centers in two places solution, the same services exists in multiple availableZones. It is necessary to implement the application in the same AZ with priority. If there is a problem with the same AZ, it must be able to access another AZ. To ensure the reliability of the service. ServiceComb provides data center configuration to partition and manage microservices. The data center contains three attributes: servicecomb.datacenter.name, servicecomb.datacenter.region, servicecomb.datacenter.availableZone, data center information does not provide isolation capabilities, and microservices can discover instances of other data centers. However, you can prioritize sending messages to a specified zone or zone by enabling instance affinity. When the client is routing, the request will be forwarded to the instance with the same zone/region, and then the instance with the same region but different zones. When they are all different, select one according to the routing rules. Affinity is not logical isolation. As long as the network between the instances is interconnected, it is possible to access it; if the network is unreachable, the access will fail. When the cloud is deployed on the Huawei cloud, the values of the region and the availableZone can be associated with the Huawei cloud region (for example, cn-north-1) and the available region. However, because the different regions on the Huawei cloud do not communicate with each other, the network is not interconnected, so it does not support cross-region access; in addition to the region value corresponding to Huawei cloud, you can also define other values by yourself, and adjust accordingly according to the actual situation, which is very flexible.

ServiceComb provides data center configuration to partition and manage microservices. The data center contains three attributes: servicecomb.datacenter.name, servicecomb.datacenter.region, servicecomb.datacenter.availableZone, data center information does not provide isolation capabilities, and microservices can discover instances of other data centers.

A: ServiceComb is a set of microservice development frameworks based on large-scale IT system practices. It encapsulates a set of microservices running models based on best practices in development. These capabilities are completely transparent to users,it can be integrated and adjusted by configuration. In the operation and maintenance phase, microservices operation and maintenance have been fully considered, providing rich monitoring indicators and dynamic governance capabilities. B: ServiceComb's capabilities can be used as a separate development framework, in a scenario that requires a lightweight microservice solution, or on SpringCloud, working with other components provided by SpringCloud, in heavyweight The scene together with SpringCloud produces a '1+1>2' effect. Q: Do we have a problem with IntelliJ's free version? A: No problem, use IntelliJ development, refer to [Setup Developer Environment] (/cn/developers/setup-develop-environment/) for the corresponding environment configuration. Q: What need to be cautious when using Java-Chassis? A: There are a few restrictions when using Java-Chassis: * Before version 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT, it does not support annotations like @GetMapping . * When using the same HTTP request method, e.g. GET, the method name need to be unique as it will become operation ID when swagger generates contracts. * Class and method name need to be public. Q: Contract generation will report error: 'Caused by: java.lang.Error: OperationId must be unique', does not support function overriding? A: We support function overriding, plus the @ApiOperation tag. There are examples in demo-pojo. Each interface must have a unique operation id. Q: When using the spring-boot-starter-provider dependency, property like spring.main.web-environment not working in application.yml file. A: When you need both the starter provider dependency and the servlet, you need to declare spring.main.web-environment in application.properties file or declare it in application.yml file and create an empty application.properties file. Q: What's the dependency differences between gateway and other microservices? xml <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-provider</artifactId> A: Gateway depends on not only the spring-boot-starter-provider , but also the spring-boot-starter-discovery . This can refer to the manger implementation of LinuxCon-Beijing-Workshop . Q: Do gateway need to configure assembly like the other microservices? Is /maven/gateway the default path of the docker maven plugin? A: Yes. Docker maven plugin relies on the assembly files to generate docker image. /maven is the default path of docker maven plugin and /gateway is the path defined in the assembly file. Q: Are there any restrictions of the return type of our API? Should it be the type of ResponseEntity? A: No, examples can refer to the implementation of integration-test in java-chassis. Q: After the microservice is started, the interface cannot be called correctly, or is there no error returned? A: Please check that the calling path is exactly the same as the path published in the Producer implementation code. The boot log on the Producer side can see the output of the map path, for example: [INFO] Swagger mapped \"{[/hello/], method=[GET], produces=[application/json]}\" For different programming styles (models) to implement Producer documentation and notes, please see: Jaxrs SpringMVC Pojo Spring Boot . 10. Q: The port number under the microservice.yaml configuration file has been modified via eclipse. After starting the program, the port number does not work? A: You need to import the sample project alone. If you import the entire ServiceComb-Java-Chassis project, the IDE will not compile the sample because the sample directory is not in the ServiceComb-Java-Chassis module. There is no error message under eclipse. Prompt message. Therefore, eclipse starts the demo of the sample and will find that the modified port does not work. 12. Q: How do I customize the HTTP status code in the REST interface for a Java method? A: For normal return values, you can do this with SwaggerAnnotation, for example: java @ApiResponse(code = 300, response = String.class, message = \"\") public int test(int x) { return 100; } For the return value of the exception, you can do this by throwing a custom InvocationException, for example: ```java public String testException(int code) { String strCode = String.valueOf(code); switch (code) { case 200: return strCode; case 456: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, strCode + \" error\"); case 556: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, Arrays.asList(strCode + \" error\")); case 557: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, Arrays.asList(Arrays.asList(strCode + \" error\"))); default: break; } return \"not expected\"; } ``` Q: How to customize the log configuration of your own microservice? A: ServiceComb does not bind the logger, just uses slf4j, users can freely choose log4j/log4j2/logback and so on. ServiceComb provides a log4j extension that supports incremental configuration of log4j's properties files on a standard log4j basis. * By default, the configuration file is loaded by the rule: \"classpath*:config/log4j.properties\" * Actually search all the config/log4j.properties and config/log4j.*.properties in the classpath, and cut out the \\* from the searched file to perform alpha. Sort, then load in order, and the final synthesized file is used as the log4j configuration file. * If you want to use ServiceComb's log4j extension, you need to call Log4jUtils.init, otherwise it will be used according to the rules of the standard logger. Q: When the service is configured with multiple transports, how do you choose which transport to use at runtime? A: * ServiceComb's consumer, transport, handler, and producer are decoupled, and each function works together through contract definitions, namely: Consumer use transparent rpc, or springmvc development and use of highway, or RESTful transmission on the network does not matter with the producer is to use transparent rpc, or jaxrs, or springmvc development, there is no relationship between the receiver is not perceived, business development methods and transmission methods * Consumer access to the producer, at the runtime's transport selection, the general rule is: The consumer's transport and the producer's endpoint take the intersection. If there are multiple transports after the intersection, they are used in turn. Decomposed, there are the following scenarios: * When a microservice producer opens both the highway and the RESTful endpoint * Only the highway transport jar is deployed in the consumer process, only the producer's highway endpoint is accessed. * Only the RESTful transport jar is deployed in the consumer process, only the RESTful endpoint of the producer is accessed. * In the consumer process, both the highway and RESTful transport jars are deployed, and the producer's highway and RESTful endpoints are accessed in turn. If, at this time, the consumer wants to use a transport to access the producer, it can be configured in the microservice.yaml of the consumer process, specifying the name of the transport: yaml Servicecomb: References: <service_name>: Transport: highway * When a microservice producer only opens the endpoint of the highway * The consumer process only deploys the highway transport jar, then the highway access is normally used. *The consumer process only deploys RESTful transport jars and cannot be accessed * The consumer process deploys both the highway and the RESTful transport jar, and the highway access is normally used. * When a microservice producer only opens RESTful endpoints *The consumer process only deploys the highway transport jar and cannot access it. * The consumer process only deploys RESTful transport jars, which normally uses RESTful access. * The consumer process deploys both the highway and the RESTful transport jar, and the RESTful access is normally used. Q: The swagger body parameter type is incorrectly defined, causing the content registered in the service center to have no type information Symptom: Define the following interface, put the parameters into the body to pass yaml /testInherate: Post: operationId: \"testInherate\" Parameters: - in: \"body\" Name: \"xxxxx\" Required: false Type: string Responses: 200: Description: \"response of 200\" Schema: $ref: \"#/definitions/ResponseImpl\" Define the interface in the above way. After the service is registered, the interface type: string that is queried from the service center is lost and becomes: yaml /testInherate: Post: operationId: \"testInherate\" Parameters: - in: \"body\" Name: \"xxxxx\" Required: false Responses: 200: Description: \"response of 200\" Schema: $ref: \"#/definitions/ResponseImpl\" If the client does not place a swagger, the following exception is also reported: text Caused by: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Method \"testInherate\" in class ? has illegal signature \" A: When defining the type of the body parameter, you need to use the schema. You cannot use type directly. yaml /testInherate: Post: operationId: \"testInherate\" Parameters: - in: \"body\" Name: \"request\" Required: false Schema: Type: string Responses: 200: Description: \"response of 200\" Schema: $ref: \"#/definitions/ResponseImpl\" Q: Does the ServiceComb microservices framework service innovate via long connection? A: http request via a long connection (with a timeout), and the highway mode also via a long connection (all the time). Q: Is the service disconnected service center registration information automatically deleted? A: The service center heartbeat detects that the service instance is unavailable, only the service instance information is removed, and the static data of the service is not removed. Q: How to implement service registration if you use the tomcat method to integrate the ServiceComb microservices framework A: If you use the ServiceComb sdk servlet method (using the transport-rest-servlet dependency) to deploy to the tomcat as a war package, you need to ensure that the rest port configuration in the service description file (microservice.yaml) is consistent with the external container to implement the service. Register correctly. Otherwise, the tomcat open port cannot be perceived. Q: If you use the tomcat method to integrate the ServiceComb microservices framework, how to register the context of the war package deployment to the service center when the service is registered A: When publishing the service interface, you need to put the context of the war package deployment at the front of the baseurl, so that the path registered to the service center is the complete path (including the context). Example: java @path(/{context}/xxx) Class ServiceA Q: How does the ServiceComb microservices framework implement data transparent transmission between multiple microservices A: Transmitting data into: java CseHttpEntity<xxxx.class> httpEntity = new CseHttpEntity<>(xxx); / / Transparent content httpEntity.addContext(\"contextKey\",\"contextValue\"); ResponseEntity<String> responseEntity = RestTemplateBuilder.create().exchange(\"cse://springmvc/springmvchello/sayhello\",HttpMethod.POST, httpEntity, String.class); Transparent data acquisition: java @Override @RequestMapping(path=\"/sayhello\",method = RequestMethod.POST) Public String sayHello(@RequestBody Person person, InvocationContext context){ / / Transparent data acquisition context.getContext(); Return \"Hello person \" + person.getName(); } Q: How does the ServiceComb microservices framework service customize the return status code? A: java @Override @RequestMapping(path = \"/sayhello\",method = RequestMethod.POST) Public String sayHello(@RequestBody Person person){ InvocationContext context = ContextUtils.getInvocationContext(); / / Custom status code context.setStatus(Status.CREATED); Return \"Hello person \"+person.getName(); } Q: Partial exposure of ServiceComb body Model A: There may be some attributes in the body object corresponding to an interface. You don't want to open it. Do not bring it out when generating the schema. Use: java @ApiModelProperty(hidden = true) Q: ServiceComb framework gets the address of the remote consumer A: If you use the http rest method (using the transport-rest-vertx dependency) you can get it in the following way: java AbstractProducerContextArgMapper httpRequestCreator = (AbstractProducerContextArgMapper)invocation.getHandlerContext().get(RestConst.HTTP_REQUEST_CREATOR); If(httpRequestCreator != null){ HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest)httpRequestCreator.createContextArg(invocation); System.out.println(req.getRemoteHost()); } The actual scenario is to take the outermost address, so LB should be passed to edgeservice, and edgeService should be passed outside the context. Q: ServiceComb describes the handler A: The consumer default handler is simpleLB. When there is no configuration, the handler chain will use this. If the handler is configured, it must contain the lb handler. Otherwise, the call error is reported in the document. Q: ServiceComb log replacement A: CSE java-chassis log recommendation method is to use Log4jUtils.init() at startup, directly use the recommended Log4j for log management, but some scenarios do not want to use log4j, such as want to use log4j2 or logback, below log4j2 Take a brief introduction to the next step: 1. Do not use Log4jUtils.init() in the code; 2. Remove the log4j configuration file (it doesn't matter if you don't delete it, because it won't be used); 3. Exclude the log4j introduced by the CSE framework, for example: xml <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>provider-springmvc</artifactId> <exclusions> <exclusion> <groupId>log4j</groupId> <artifactId>log4j</artifactId> </exclusion> </exclusions> </dependency> 4. Introducing the dependency of log4j2 xml <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId> <artifactId>log4j-slf4j-impl</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId> <artifactId>log4j-api</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId> <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId> </dependency> If there is no version dependency management, you need to fill in the version number. 5. Add the log4j2 configuration file log4j2.xml. Please check the official description for this, for example: xml <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <!--Log level and priority ordering: OFF > FATAL > ERROR > WARN > INFO > DEBUG > TRACE > ALL --> <!--Configuration behind the configuration, this is used to set the internal information output of log4j2, can not be set, when set to trace, you will see various detailed output inside log4j2 --> <!--monitorInterval: Log4j can automatically detect the modified configuration file and reconfigure itself, set the interval seconds --> <configuration status=\"WARN\" monitorInterval=\"30\"> <!--First define all appender--> <appenders> <!--This output console configuration --> <console name=\"Console\" target=\"SYSTEM_OUT\"> <!--Format of output log --> <PatternLayout pattern=\"[%d{HH:mm:ss:SSS}] [%p] - %l - %m%n\"/> </console> <!--The file will print out all the information, this log will be automatically cleared every time the program is run, determined by the append attribute, this is also very useful, suitable for temporary testing --> <File name=\"log\" fileName=\"log/test.log\" append=\"false\"> <PatternLayout pattern=\"%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %class{36} %L %M - %msg%xEx%n\"/> </File> <!-- This will print out all info and the following level information.

Start the service for verification Q: Service timeout setting A: Add the following configuration to the microservice description file (microservice.yaml): yaml servicecomb: request: timeout: 30000 Q: The URL address can be uniquely located. Why do you want to add a schema? A: 1. The schema is used to match the service contract. It is used to ensure that the server and the consumer contract are compatible. Each contract needs a unique ID and is stored in the service center. 2. Schema maps to the interface concept of java. When the consumer uses the transparent rpc mode to develop, it can find which operation in the micro service. The method names between schemas are not unique. 3. operation qualified name is the key of the governance, and the URL cannot be directly searched because of the existence of the path parameter, and the qualified name will not change. Governance does not distinguish between transmissions. If governance goes by URL, then when highway is called in, it has to construct the url according to the parameters, and then the regular expression matches, which is too tossing. 4. http is just a transport channel, and there are other transport channels that do not need to be mapped to URLs. Q: When the Rest client is invocating, it only takes the service name and URL, and does not need to specify the schema id. In fact, according to this URL, the specific contract can also be found. So what is the role of the specified schema id? A: Since transparent rpc is an interface call and does not have a URL, the internal is actually normalized to the operation to describe, so that it can be uniquely mapped to the specific request processing in conjunction with the schema id. Q: What is the concept of Transport? What is it used for? A: The Transport is responsible for codec, and transmission. The communication model has two kinds of Rest and Highway. The Highway corresponds to the private protocol, which uses protobuf encoding, and the Rest uses json. Highway and Rest are based on vertx, and vertx is based on netty. Q: Is there be multiple appIDs and microservices in a service provider? What scenario will this happen? A: Yes, what is expressed here is a concept of merge. The microservice.yaml file, which may exist in both jars, disks, and command line arguments, specifies that they are merged by priority and are used for added flexibility. In the jar is the default value, in addition to the environment variables, command line parameters, configuration center coverage, providing multiple layers of customization. Q: How does ServiceComb interact with the service center? A: Take the rest, mainly responsible for registration, taking data and heartbeat, etc.; 'watch event' via websocket, watch event is to observe whether the service center instance information has changed. Q: Is there a governance center like dubbo? A: bizkeeper is a handler, one of the contents of governance. Governance can be extended by handlers. Q: How to understand the service path? A: Each microservice has a servicePathManager, and each schema registers its own path. Q: Can the browser directly access the microservice Endpoint? A: Yes, the restful microservice Endpoint can be used to access the service that provides the get method directly in the browser using HTTP plus service path. If it is to access the services provided by other Http methods, it is recommended to install and use.(https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/api-tools-postman-install.html) Q: When the contract is generated, do you have to add the version number and language? A: The contract belongs to the microservice. The microservice has a version, but the language should not be accompanied by the version number. Contractual requirements should be independent of language. The contract \"no version\", the version of the contract is embodied in the microservice, the instance can find the version of the microservice to which it belongs, and a certain contract can be found. Q: The design code in ServiceRegistry is similar to Eureka? A: Our first version was built on the basis of Spring Cloud. Later, when we found that it was not enough to use it, we gradually made our own set, so it was designed after fully referring to Eureka. Q: Some rpc is netty calling redis implementation, what is the advantage over direct netty forwarding? A: Maybe I want to use Redis to solve the subscription release. But this is not a big deal. I tried it before, but later I changed it to ServiceComb. Q: If you introduce the transport-rest-servlet and transport-rest-vertx dependencies at the same time, how does it decide which one to use? A: If the port is not occupied, use vertx; if it is occupied, use servlet. Q: What is the scenario for qps flow control design? A: Rate limit has two main functions. First, it guarantees the service effect to some key services by restricting different consumers, and the second is to prevent the avalanche effect. The thickness of the water pipe can be determined according to the importance of the service. ServiceComb supports two types of current limiting methods, namely, consumer-side current limiting and server-side current limiting. The consumer-side current limiting can achieve relatively fine control. Q: If the server is a chain call, that is, a->b->c, then does the QPS flow control cause flow pipe uneven and unbalanced? A: The general mode is to measure and then set. The qps settings are ultimately tuned in conjunction with the overall business needs, rather than setting them up on a single node. Q: The service failed to be invoked via cse://serviceName/appPath, error: java.lang.Error:not support def type:class io.swagger.models.properties xxx A: Check whether the version of java-chassis that the consumer and provider depend on are consistent. If they are inconsistent, please modify and use the newer version. Q: When sending a rest request, the following error is reported: Bad Request, description: http:request body too large A: Check if the Service Center is older version, and if so, upgrade to the latest version. Q: How to ignore the attributes specified in the contract DTO? A: If you are using 'rest transport', because it is Json serialization, you can use @JsonIgnore annotations to mark attributes that need to be ignored; 'highway transport' is not currently supported. Note that you need to update the version of the microservice after the modification, for example: java public class OutputForTest{ @JsonIgnore private String outputId = null; private String inputId = null; ... } Q: How to get the value of a field in the header in a user-defined handler A: Use the @ApiImplicitParams annotation declaration in the user-defined handler and the invocation.getArgs() to get the value of the header. E.g: java public class MyHandler implements Handler { @ApiImplicitParams({@ApiImplicitParam(name = \"tester\", dataType = \"string\", paramType = \"header\")}) @Override public void handle(Invocation invocation, AsyncResponse asyncResp) throws Exception { Object[] args = invocation.getArgs(); System.out.println(args); } } Q: The exception is thrown when the microservices runtime: java.lang.Error:not support def type:calss io.swagger.models.properties BaseIntegerProperty ? A: Service Center can be upgraded to version 4.0.0+ to solve [Service Center latest version portal] (http://apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/servicecomb/incubator-servicecomb-service-center /1.0.0-m1/). . Q: Our API can not be accessed after microservices are up. It just returns 404 Not Found . The codes we use is as follows: * java @RestController @RestSchema(schemaId = \"worker\") public class WorkerController { @RequestMapping(value=\"/count\", method=RequestMethod.GET) public int getWorkerNumbers() { ... } } A: Without specifying the base path, ServiceComb will use the classname as the base path. Hence, the path should be /WorkerController/count in the previous code. If you want to access path like /count , you need to specify base path as / as follows: java @RequestMapping(value = \"/\") public class WorkerController {} . Q: What\\'s the default base path if I have not declared the value of RequestMapping annotation? * A: Supposed the class name of your controller is HelloController , the base path is /HelloController.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"question-and-answer/interface-compatibility/","text":"In the process of continuous iterative development of microservices, due to the continuous addition of new features, some old features are continually being modified, and interface compatibility issues face enormous challenges, especially in the running environment multi-version coexistence (grayscale release) ). This chapter mainly describes some practical suggestions for interface compatibility management and solutions to compatibility problems during use. Since microservices generally provide services externally through the REST interface, the interface here refers to the REST interface without special instructions. Practice of ensuring interface compatibility To prevent interface compatibility problems, developers are advised to follow the following principles when making interface changes (add, modify, delete, etc.). Only add interfaces, do not modify or delete interfaces. As a Provider, when adding an interface, the microservice version number is incremented accordingly. For example, change 2.1.2 to 2.1.3. As a Consumer, when using the new interface of the Provider, specify the minimum version number of the Provider. For example: servicecomb.references.[serviceName].version-rule=2.1.3+, The serviceName is the Provider's microservice name. In the service center, regularly clean up the old version of microservice information that is no longer used. If microservice version number is not changed and when startup, the meta info in service center will not overridden. The Consumers see old meta data. To prevent this happen, ServiceComb will stop boot when incompatible interface change and version is the same. In newly developed project, use development environment to bypass this check. service_description: environment: development Please notice that consumer is also need reboot or old interface metadata will be used. interface compatibility common problems and their solutions During the development phase, due to various interface modification, the data of the service center would not be cleaned up, and the interface call fails when debugging. Developers are advised to install and download a [frontend] of the service center (http://apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/servicecomb/incubator-servicecomb-service-center/1.0.0-m1/), anytime Clean up service center data. If you use Huawei's public cloud online service center, you can log in directly using the management functions provided by the microservice engine to delete. During the release phase, you need to review the steps of the interface-compatible practices to ensure that interface compatibility issues are not online. If you accidentally miss one of these steps, it may lead to the following interface compatibility issues: If the interface is modified or deleted: some old Consumers will fail to request the new route of the new Provider. If you forget to modify the microservice version number: some new Consumers will fail to request the route of the old Provider. If you forget to configure the minimum dependent version of the Consumer: when the deployment order is to stop the Consumer first, then start the Consumer, then stop the Provider, and then start the Provider. The Consumer cannot obtain the new interface information, and the old interface is used. When the Provider starts, The Consumer initiates a call to the new interface that fails; or fails to call the new interface before the Provider started. Workarounds for problems: There are different interface compatibility issues and different handling methods. In extreme cases, you only need to clean up the Provider and Consumer microservices, and then restart the microservice. When the service call relationship is complexed, the interface compatibility problem will be more extensive and clean the Provider, and Consumer data will become complicated. Therefore, it is recommended to follow the above specifications to avoid incompatibility.","title":"Micro Service Interface Compatibility FAQ"},{"location":"question-and-answer/interface-compatibility/#practice-of-ensuring-interface-compatibility","text":"To prevent interface compatibility problems, developers are advised to follow the following principles when making interface changes (add, modify, delete, etc.).

Solution: For normal return values, this can be done with SwaggerAnnotation, for example: @ApiResponse(code = 300, response = String.class, message = \"\") public int test(int x) { return 100; } For the return value of the exception, you can do this by throwing a custom InvocationException, for example: public String testException(int code) { String strCode = String.valueOf(code); switch (code) { case 200: return strCode; case 456: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, strCode + \" error\"); case 556: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, Arrays.asList(strCode + \" error\")); case 557: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, Arrays.asList(Arrays.asList(strCode + \" error\"))); default: break; } return \"not expected\"; } Problem: How to customize the log configuration of your own microservice Solution: ServiceComb does not bind the logger, use slf4j, users can freely choose log4j/log4j2/logback and so on. ServiceComb provides a log4j extension that supports incremental configuration of log4j's properties files on a standard log4j basis. By default, the configuration file is loaded from the path: \"classpath*:config/log4j.properties\" It will actually search all the config/log4j.properties and config/log4j.*.properties in the classpath, cut out the \\* part from the searched file, sort the alpha, then load it in order, and finally compose The file is used as the log4j configuration file. If you want to use ServiceComb's log4j extension, you need to call Log4jUtils.init, otherwise it will be used according to the rules of the standard logger. Problem: When the service is configured with multiple types of transport, What are the mechanisms for ServiceComb choose which transport to use at runtime? Solution: ServiceComb's consumer, transport, handler, and producer are decoupled. The functions work together through contract definitions, that is, whether the consumer uses transparent rpc, or springmvc develops and uses a highway, or RESTful does not transmit on the network. Relationships and producers use transparent rpc, or jaxrs, or springmvc development, and there is no relationship between the receiver and the perception, business development methods and transmission methods. Consumer access producer, in the runtime transport selection, the general rule is: the consumer's transport and producer's endpoint intersection, if there are multiple transports after the intersection, then use in turn Decomposed, there are the following scenarios: When a microservice producer provided both the highway and the RESTful endpoint Only the highway transport jar is deployed in the consumer process, only the producer's highway endpoint is accessed. * Only the RESTful transport jar is deployed in the consumer process, only the RESTful endpoint of the producer is accessed. * The consumer process, while deploying the highway and RESTful transport jar, will take turns accessing the producer's highway, RESTful endpoint If at this time, the consumer wants to use a transport to access the producer, it can be configured in the microservice.yaml of the consumer process, specifying the name of the transport: servicecomb: references: transport: <service_name>: highway When a microservice producer only provided the endpoint of the highway * The consumer process only deploys the highway transport jar, and normally uses higway endpoint. * The consumer process can only be accessed if only the RESTful transport jar is deployed * The consumer process deploys both the highway and the RESTful transport jar, and the highway access is normally used. When a microservice producer only provided RESTful endpoints * The consumer process only deploys the highway transport jar and cannot access it. * The consumer process only deploys RESTful transport jars, which normally use RESTful access * The consumer process deploys both the highway and the RESTful transport jar, and the RESTful access is normally used. Problem: The swagger body parameter type is incorrectly defined, resulting in no content information for the content registered by the service center. Symptom: Define the following interface, put the parameters into the body to pass /testInherate: post: operationId: \"testInherate\" parameters: - in: \"body\" name: \"xxxxx\" required: false type: string responses: 200: description: \"response of 200\" schema: $ref: \"#/definitions/ReponseImpl\" Define the interface in the above way. After the service is registered, the interface type: a string that is queried from the service center is lost and becomes: /testInherate: post: operationId: \"testInherate\" parameters: - in: \"body\" name: \"xxxxx\" required: false responses: 200: description: \"response of 200\" schema: $ref: \"#/definitions/ReponseImpl\" If the client does not place a swagger, the following exception is also reported: Caused by: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Method \"testInherate\" in class ? has illegal signature. \" Solution: When defining the type of the body parameter, you can't use type directly instead use the schema. /testInherate: post: operationId: \"testInherate\" parameters: - in: \"body\" name: \"request\" required: false schema: type: string responses: 200: description: \"response of 200\" schema: $ref: \"#/definitions/ReponseImpl\" Problem: Does the microservices framework service call use long live connection? Solution: Http uses a long connection (with a timeout), and the highway mode uses a long connection (always on). Problem: When the service is disconnected from the service center, will the registration information be deleted automatically? Solution: The service center heartbeat detects that the service instance is unavailable, only the service instance information is removed, and the static data of the service is not removed. Problem: How does the microservices framework achieve transparent transmission of data between multiple microservices? Solution: Transmitting data into: CseHttpEntity<xxxx.class> httpEntity = new CseHttpEntity<>(xxx); //Transmission content httpEntity.addContext(\"contextKey\",\"contextValue\"); ResponseEntity<String> responseEntity = RestTemplateBuilder.create().exchange(\"cse://springmvc/springmvchello/sayhello\",HttpMethod.POST,httpEntity,String.class); Transparent data acquisition: @Override @RequestMapping(path=\"/sayhello\",method = RequestMethod.POST) public String sayHello(@RequestBody Person person,InvocationContext context){ //Transparent data acquisition context.getContext(); return \"Hello person \" + person.getName(); } Problem: How the microservices framework service customizes the return status code Solution: @Override @RequestMapping(path = \"/sayhello\",method = RequestMethod.POST) public String sayHello(@RequestBody Person person){ InvocationContext context = ContextUtils.getInvocationContext(); //\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u7801 context.setStatus(Status.CREATED); return \"Hello person \"+person.getName(); } Problem: Partial exposure of body Model Solution: In the body object corresponding to an interface, there may be some attributes that are internal. Do not want to open it. Do not bring it out when generating the schema. Use: @ApiModelProperty(hidden = true) Problem: The framework obtains the address of the remote consumer Solution: If you use the http rest method (using the transport-rest-vertx dependency) you can get it in the following way: HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest) invocation.getHandlerContext().get(RestConst.REST_REQUEST); String host = request.getRemoteHost(); The actual scene is to take the external address, so it should be LB passed to edgeservice, and edgeService is then passed to the context and passed. Problem: Description of the handler Solution: Consumer default handler is simpleLB, and the handler chain will use this when there is no configuration, if the handler is configured, it must contain the lb handler. Otherwise the call error, need to be described in the document. Problem: Netty version problem Solution: Netty3 and netty4 are completely different tripartites because the coordinates are not the same as the package, so they can coexist, but pay attention to the minor version problem, the version that the small version must use. Problem: Service Timeout Settings Solution: Add the following configuration to the microservice description file (microservice.yaml): servicecomb: request: timeout: 30000 Problem: Is there a required for the processing chain's sequence of service governance? Solution: The order of the processing chains is different, and the system works differently. List the common questions below. 1, loadbalance and bizkeeper-consumer These two sequences can be combined randomly. But the behavior is different. When loadbalance is in the front, the retry function provided by loadbalance will occur when bizkeeper-consumer throws an exception, such as timeout. But if you have done a fallback policy configuration, such as return null, then loadbalance will not retry. If loadbalance is behind, the retry will extend the timeout. Even if the retry is successful, if the timeout period set by bizkeeper-consumer is not enough, the final call result will also fail. 2, tracing-consumer, sla-consumer, tracing-provider, sla-provider These processing chains are recommended to be placed at the very beginning of the processing chain to ensure that the success and failure of the log can be recorded (because the log requires IP and other information, for consumers, can only be placed behind the loadbalance). If you do not need to record the exception returned by the client, you can put it to the end and only pay attention to the error returned by the network layer. However, if the bizkeeper-consumer timeout returns earlier, the log may not be logged. Suggested order Consumer: loadbalance, tracing-consumer, sla-consumer, bizkeeper-consumer Provider: tracing-provider, sla-provider, bizkeeper-provider This order is sufficient for most scenarios and is not easy to cause errors. Problem: the meaning of config item servicecomb.uploads.maxSize in file uploading config item: servicecomb.uploads.maxSize meaning: The maximum allowable size of http body in bytes, the default value of -1 means unlimited.","title":"Q & A"},{"location":"question-and-answer/question_answer/#problem-how-to-customize-the-http-status-code-in-the-rest-interface-corresponding-to-a-java-method","text":"Solution: For normal return values, this can be done with SwaggerAnnotation, for example: @ApiResponse(code = 300, response = String.class, message = \"\") public int test(int x) { return 100; } For the return value of the exception, you can do this by throwing a custom InvocationException, for example: public String testException(int code) { String strCode = String.valueOf(code); switch (code) { case 200: return strCode; case 456: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, strCode + \" error\"); case 556: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, Arrays.asList(strCode + \" error\")); case 557: throw new InvocationException(code, strCode, Arrays.asList(Arrays.asList(strCode + \" error\"))); default: break; } return \"not expected\"; }","title":"Problem: How to customize the HTTP status code in the REST interface corresponding to a Java method?"},{"location":"question-and-answer/question_answer/#problem-how-to-customize-the-log-configuration-of-your-own-microservice","text":"Solution: ServiceComb does not bind the logger, use slf4j, users can freely choose log4j/log4j2/logback and so on.

Consumer access producer, in the runtime transport selection, the general rule is: the consumer's transport and producer's endpoint intersection, if there are multiple transports after the intersection, then use in turn Decomposed, there are the following scenarios: When a microservice producer provided both the highway and the RESTful endpoint Only the highway transport jar is deployed in the consumer process, only the producer's highway endpoint is accessed. * Only the RESTful transport jar is deployed in the consumer process, only the RESTful endpoint of the producer is accessed. * The consumer process, while deploying the highway and RESTful transport jar, will take turns accessing the producer's highway, RESTful endpoint If at this time, the consumer wants to use a transport to access the producer, it can be configured in the microservice.yaml of the consumer process, specifying the name of the transport: servicecomb: references: transport: <service_name>: highway When a microservice producer only provided the endpoint of the highway * The consumer process only deploys the highway transport jar, and normally uses higway endpoint. * The consumer process can only be accessed if only the RESTful transport jar is deployed * The consumer process deploys both the highway and the RESTful transport jar, and the highway access is normally used. When a microservice producer only provided RESTful endpoints * The consumer process only deploys the highway transport jar and cannot access it. * The consumer process only deploys RESTful transport jars, which normally use RESTful access * The consumer process deploys both the highway and the RESTful transport jar, and the RESTful access is normally used.","title":"Problem: When the service is configured with multiple types of transport, What are the mechanisms for ServiceComb choose which transport to use at runtime?"},{"location":"question-and-answer/question_answer/#problem-the-swagger-body-parameter-type-is-incorrectly-defined-resulting-in-no-content-information-for-the-content-registered-by-the-service-center","text":"Symptom: Define the following interface, put the parameters into the body to pass /testInherate: post: operationId: \"testInherate\" parameters: - in: \"body\" name: \"xxxxx\" required: false type: string responses: 200: description: \"response of 200\" schema: $ref: \"#/definitions/ReponseImpl\" Define the interface in the above way.

When loadbalance is in the front, the retry function provided by loadbalance will occur when bizkeeper-consumer throws an exception, such as timeout. But if you have done a fallback policy configuration, such as return null, then loadbalance will not retry. If loadbalance is behind, the retry will extend the timeout. Even if the retry is successful, if the timeout period set by bizkeeper-consumer is not enough, the final call result will also fail. 2, tracing-consumer, sla-consumer, tracing-provider, sla-provider These processing chains are recommended to be placed at the very beginning of the processing chain to ensure that the success and failure of the log can be recorded (because the log requires IP and other information, for consumers, can only be placed behind the loadbalance). If you do not need to record the exception returned by the client, you can put it to the end and only pay attention to the error returned by the network layer. However, if the bizkeeper-consumer timeout returns earlier, the log may not be logged.

The first part DiscoveryTree, whose core part is DiscoveryFilter, groups microservice instances by their interface compatibility, data center, status, etc. The second part is the load balancing scheme based on Ribbon, which supports various load balancing policies(IRule) include random, sequential, response time-based weights, and ServerListFilterExt which is based on Invocation state. DiscoveryTree's logic is more complex, its processing progress is as below: Load balancing can be configured in the Consumer processing chain, the handler name is loadbalance, as follows: servicecomb: handler: chain: Consumer: default: loadbalance POM dependence: <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>handler-loadbalance</artifactId> </dependency> Routing and forwarding by data center information Service providers and consumers can declare their service center information in microservice.yaml: servicecomb: datacenter: name: mydatacenter region: my-Region availableZone: my-Zone Consumers compare their own data center information and providers' information, preferentially forward the request to the provider instance in the same region and availableZone; if the target instance is not available, it forwards request to the instance in the same region; if the target still does not exist, it forwards requests to other instances. The region and availableZone here are general concepts, users can determine their business meanings to apply them to resource-isolated scenarios. See Logical isolation relationships between microservice instances for more details of the isolation. This rule is enabled by default. If it is not needed, set servicecomb.loadbalance.filter.zoneaware.enabled to false. Data center information isolation is implemented in ZoneAwareDiscoveryFilter. Routing and forwarding by instance attributes Users can specify the properties of microservice instances in microservice.yaml, or by calling service center APIs. instance_description: properties: tags: tag_key: tag_value Consumers can specify provider instances' attributes to determine which instances to call. servicecomb: loadbalance: # Here the \"provider\" means the config items below only take effect on the service named \"provider\" # In cross-app invocation, the AppID should be prefixed, like \"AppIDOfProvider:provider\" provider: transactionControl: options: tags: tag_key: expected_tag_value The above configuration shows that only the instances of \"provider\" with the tag attribute tag_key:expected_tag_value are called. This rule needs to be configured separately for each service. Global rule for all services is not supported. This rule is enabled by default, it can be disabled by setting servicecomb.loadbalance.filter.instanceProperty.enabled to false. The instance attributes based routing policy is implemented in InstancePropertyDiscoveryFilter . Routing and forwarding by instance attributes with hierarchy value This is a extension of the feature above. You can specify the properties of microservice instances in microservice.yaml with hierarchy value, which is separated by . symbol. instance_description: properties: KEY: a.b.c Consumer need to specify the key of instance which is used to match provider, the default key is environment servicecomb: loadbalance: filter: priorityInstanceProperty: key: KEY Assuming there is a consumer instance with property value a.b.c , the match priority of provider will be a.b.c > a.b > a > [empty] and the table shown below gives detail match priority. | consumer | match priority of provider| | :--- | :--- | |a.b.c|a.b.c>a.b>a>[empty]| |a.b|a.b>a>[empty]| |a|a>[empty]| |[empty]|[empty]| Note that [empty] is represent for the instances which is not set value of this property key This rule is NOT enabled by default, which can be enabled by setting servicecomb.loadbalance.filter.priorityInstanceProperty.enabled to true. The policy is implemented in PriorityInstancePropertyDiscoveryFilter . Instance isolation Developers can configure instance-isolated parameters to temporarily drop access to the wrong instance, improving system reliability and performance. Below are the configuration items and default values: servicecomb: loadbalance: isolation: enabled: true errorThresholdPercentage: 0 enableRequestThreshold: 5 singleTestTime: 60000 continuousFailureThreshold: 5 The interval of isolation calculation is 1 minute. According to the above configuration, in 1 minute, if the total number of requests is greater than 5, and more than 2 consecutive errors occur, the instance is isolated. The default value of errorThresholdPercentage is 0, indicates that the rule is ommited. The item should be a integer less than 100, for example 20, then within 1 minutes, if the total number of request is greater than 5 and [1] error rate is greater than 20% or [2] more than 2 consecutive errors occur, is instance is isolated. After 60 seconds, the instance will be re-enabled and accessible if it matches the rules of load balancing policy. Notes: When error rate reaches the threshold, is instance is isolated and the error rate will be calculated again after the interval. Then with the successful accesses, the rate will decrease and become less than the threshold, then instance is available again. Since the rate is calculated by number of requests, if the total requests reaches the threshold and the error rate is much greater than its threshold, the instance would take a long time to recover. ServiceComb starts a thread in the background to detect the instance state, and checks the instance state every 10 seconds (if the instance is accessed within 10 seconds, it is not detected). If the detection fails, the error number is accumulated with 1. The count here also affects instance isolation. The default instance state detection mechanism is to send a telnet instruction, refer to the implementation of SimpleMicroserviceInstancePing. Users can overwrite the status detection mechanism with the following two steps: Implement the MicroserviceInstancePing interface Configure SPI: Add META-INF/services/org.apache.servicecomb.serviceregistry.consumer.MicroserviceInstancePing, the content is the full path of the implementation class Developers can configure different isolation policies for different microservices.

Load Balance Load Balance \u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861 When an application accesses a microservice with multiple instances, it involves routing load balancing. Load balancing policies can be configured through configuration files to support multiple load balancing routing policies such as random, round-robin, session hold, and response time based weights. Rate limit Rate limit \u9650\u6d41 When a resource becomes a bottleneck, the service framework needs to limit the access request of the consumer and start the flow control protection mechanism. Flow control is available on both the consumer and provider sides. On the service consumer side, the frequency of requests sent to a micro service provider can be limited; on the service provider side, the frequency of requests sent by each microservice consumer can be limited, or the total consumption of the service provider can be determined according to the resource consumption of the service provider. Request frequency limits to prevent services from crashing due to resource exhaustion. Service Degrade Service Degrade \u964d\u7ea7 Service downgrade mainly includes two strategies: masked downgrade and fault tolerant downgrade: shielded downgrade refers to the decision of the operation and maintenance personnel/developers when the trigger condition of the outside world reaches a certain critical value. Or a service is forced to downgrade. Fault-tolerant degradation means that when non-core services are unavailable, business logic can be released for faulty services to ensure the operation of core services. Fault tolarance Fault tolarance \u5bb9\u9519 Fault Tolerance is a processing strategy in the scenario where an exception occurs when a consumer accesses a service. After an exception occurs, the service framework automatically selects a new service route to invoke. Circuit Breaker Circuit Breaker \u7194\u65ad There is usually a dependency between microservices. The service invocation link may contain multiple microservices. If one or more service access delays in the link are too high, the request for the portal service will continue.

The fuse mechanism is designed for the above scenario. When a target service responds slowly or a large number of timeouts occur, the service call is blown. For subsequent call requests, the target service is no longer called, directly returned, and resources are quickly released. The target service situation is improved and the call is resumed. Isolation Isolation \u9694\u79bb Service isolation is an anomaly detection mechanism. Common detection methods are request timeout, excessive traffic, and so on.

You need to create a new servlet project to wrap the microservices, pack them into war packages, and load them into the web container to run. Path for external access Not like running as a standalone process, when the microservice runs in the web container, the web root and servlet url pattern will be different. For the traditional development framework, the consumer needs to perceive the complete url of the service; for example, the web root is /mywebapp, the url pattern is /rest, and the business-level path is /application, then consumer must access the service via the url /mywebapp/rest/application. So when the deployment pattern changes, like from web container to a standalone process, the consumer or producer have to modify the code to adapt to the changes. It is recommended to use ServiceComb's deployment decoupling feature. Whether it is a consumer or a producer, the application don't perceive the web root and url pattern in the code, while ServiceComb will automatically adapt them for the producer instance at runtime. For some legacy systems, if users expect to use restTemplate.getForObject(\"cse://serviceName/mywebapp/rest/application\"...) without too many changes, then the path of the interface should be defined as /mywebapp/rest/application: @RestSchema(schemaId = \"test\") @RequestMapping(path = \"/mywebapp/rest/application\") However, it is still recommended to use a deployment-independent way to write the code, which introduces less code modifications when the deployment pattern changes. maven dependencies <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>transport-rest-servlet</artifactId> </dependency> Configurations When integrating with servlet, there are a few concepts involved: Start spring context Note the following startup methods cannot be used at the same time, just choose one of them.

methods will enable the full functionality of the java chassis. The JAVA application mode runs on a separate HTTP server (based on vert.x), which has great advantages in performance. The web development method runs on Tomcat or other built-in web servers and receives requests as a servlet. Therefore, during the development process, you can use some functions provided by the web container, such as providing page services and using Filter. When the application only needs to provide REST services, and performance requirements are high, it is recommended to use a JAVA application mode.","title":"The difference between JAVA application method and Web development method"},{"location":"using-java-chassis-in-spring-boot/diff-spring-mvc/","text":"Java chassis supports the use of the label (org.springframework.web.bind.annotation) provided by Spring MVC to declare the REST interface, but the two are independent implementations and have different design goals. The goal of the java chassis is to provide a cross-language framework that supports multiple communication protocols. Therefore, some features of Spring MVC that are not very good for cross-language support are removed, and features that are strongly related to a specific running framework are not supported, such as direct access to the Servlet protocol definition. HttpServletRequest. Here are some notable differences. Service declaration method Spring MVC uses @RestController to declare the service, and java chassis uses @RestSchema to declare the service and needs to display the service path using @RequestMapping to distinguish whether the service uses Spring MVC Annotations or JAX RS Annotations. @RestSchema(schemaId = \"hello\") @RequestMapping(path = \"/\") The schema is the service contract of java chassis, which is the basis of service runtime. Service management, codec and so on are all based on contract. In a cross-language scenario, the contract also defines the parts of the language that can be understood simultaneously. Data type support With Spring MVC, you can use multiple data types in a service definition as long as it can be serialized and deserialized by json. Such as: // abstract type Public void postData(@RequestBody Object data) // Interface definition Public void postData(@RequestBody IPerson interfaceData) // Generics tpye without specified type Public void postData(@RequestBody Map rawData) // specific protocol related types Public void postData(HttpServletRequest request) The above types are not supported in the java chassis. Because java chassis will generate contracts according to the interface definition, from the above interface definition, if you do not combine the actual implementation code or additional development documentation, you can not directly generate the contract. That is, standing in the REST perspective of the browser, I don't know how to construct the message content in the body. To support rapid development, the data type restrictions of java chassis are also constantly expanding, such as support for HttpServletRequest, but when they are used, they are different from the semantics of the WEB server, such as the inability to directly manipulate the stream. Therefore, it is recommended that the developer use the type of contract that can be described as much as possible in the usage scenario so that the code is more readable. For more information on java chassis support for data types, please refer to the \"Supported Data Types\" section. Common Annotation Support The following is the java chassis support for Spring MVC common annotation. Tag Name Support Description RequestMapping Yes GetMapping Yes PutMapping Yes PostMapping Yes DeleteMapping Yes PatchMapping Yes RequestParam Yes CookieValue Yes PathVariable Yes RequestHeader Yes RequestBody Yes Currently supports application/json,plain/text RequestPart Yes For file upload scenarios, the corresponding tags are Part, MultipartFile ResponseBody No The return value defaults to the body return ResponseStatus No The error code returned can be specified by ApiResponse RequestAttribute No Servlet Protocol Related Tags SessionAttribute No Servlet Protocol Related Tags MatrixVariable No ModelAttribute No ControllerAdvice No CrossOrigin No ExceptionHandler No InitBinder No Other Using POJO objects for parameter mapping in GET methods is not supported. For example: public void getOperation(Person p) Do not support the use of Map mapping in the GET method for all possible parameters. For example: public void getOperation(Map<String,String> p)","title":"The difference in Spring MVC mode"},{"location":"using-java-chassis-in-spring-boot/java-application/","text":"Using JAVA integration, an efficient HTTP server and REST development framework has been added for Spring Boot applications. This way of integration is very simple. Just introduce the relevant dependencies into the project and use the @EnableServiceComb annotation. This project [code example] (https://github.com/huaweicse/servicecomb-java-chassis-samples/tree/master/spring-boot-simple) Introducing dependencies Add the spring-boot-starter-provider to the dependency to introduce the core functions of the java chassis. The purpose of introducing hibernate-validator is that spring boot will detect the implementation class of validation-api, and it will not start if it is not detected. <dependencyManagement> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>java-chassis-dependencies</artifactId> <version>1.0.0-m1</version> <type>pom</type> <scope>import</scope> </dependency> </dependencies> </dependencyManagement> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-provider</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId> </dependency> </dependencies> Enable the core functions of java chassis Add @EnableServiceComb in front of the startup class. @SpringBootApplication @EnableServiceComb public class WebsiteMain { public static void main(final String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(WebsiteMain.class, args); } } With the above configuration, you can fully use all the functions provided by the java chassis, use the java chassis to develop REST services, and open various governance functions. Configure microservices The microservice.yaml file allows you to customize the microservice information, including the application id, microservice name, listener address and port. After integrating java chassis, you can develop REST interface through it: @RestSchema(schemaId = \"hello\") @RequestMapping(path = \"/\") public class HelloService { @RequestMapping(path = \"hello\", method = RequestMethod.GET) public String sayHello(@RequestParam(name=\"name\") String name) { return \"Hello \" + name; } } Then you can access it by http://localhost:9093/hello?name=world.","title":"JAVA application development"},{"location":"using-java-chassis-in-spring-boot/spring-mvcmo-shi-de-cha-yi/","text":"","title":"Spring mvcmo shi de cha yi"},{"location":"using-java-chassis-in-spring-boot/using-java-chassis-in-spring-boot/","text":"Spring Boot \u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u52a0\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u6784\u5efaSpring\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5982\u4e0b\u529f\u80fd\uff1a \u521b\u5efa\u72ec\u7acb\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684Spring\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6253\u5305\u4e3ajar\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7java -jar\u6765\u6267\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002 \u5185\u5d4cTomcat, Jetty\u7b49WEB\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6253\u5305war\u3002 \u63d0\u4f9bstarter\u7b80\u5316maven\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u914d\u7f6e\u3002 \u5c06Spring Boot\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6781\u5927\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002java-chassis\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6cbb\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528java chassis\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u542f\u7528\u5404\u79cd\u6ee1\u8db3\u5546\u4e1a\u8fd0\u7ef4\u9700\u8981\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002 \u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5982\u4f55\u5728Spring Boot\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4ee5\u5982\u4e0b\u51e0\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528Spring Boot\uff1a JAVA\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a\u5f15\u5165spring-boot-starter\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u666e\u901aJAVA\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u4f1a\u542f\u52a8WEB\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002 Web\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a\u5f15\u5165spring-boot-starter-web\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1Web\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u4f1a\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u5d4c\u7684Tomcat\u6216\u8005Jetty\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528The Spring Web MVC framework\uff08\u7b80\u79f0Spring MVC\uff09\u5f00\u53d1REST\u63a5\u53e3\u3002 \u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u96c6\u6210java chassis\uff0c\u539f\u7406\u56fe\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a JAVA\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f \u8fd9\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06java chassis\u901a\u8fc7Spring Boot\u5e94\u7528\u62c9\u8d77\uff0c\u4e0d\u6d89\u53ca\u4efb\u4f55\u6539\u9020\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u3002 Web\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u5f0f \u8be5\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u5c06Spring MVC\u7684DispatcherServlet\u66ff\u6362\u4e3ajava chassis\u7684RestServlet\u3002","title":"Intruductions"},{"location":"using-java-chassis-in-spring-boot/web-application/","text":"The development steps of the web development mode and the JAVA application mode are similar. This project [code example] (https://github.com/huaweicse/servicecomb-java-chassis-samples/tree/master/spring-boot-web) Mainly differences: JAVA application is based on spring-boot-starter, and web development is based on spring-boot-starter-web. JAVA application depends on spring-boot-starter-provider, while web development depends on spring-boot-starter-transport. Spring-boot-starter-web already carries hibernate-validator and does not require additional dependencies. In the startup function, the web development mode can be declared @SpringBootApplication(exclude=DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration.class) To close org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet, enable org.apache.servicecomb.transport.rest.servlet.RestServlet via @EnableServiceComb. Although it is not necessary to exclude the DispatcherServlet, it is not a good idea to have multiple REST frameworks in a microservice in most scenarios, which will cause much confusion in use. Specify the URL root path of the RestServlet in the microservice.yaml file via the configuration item servicecomb.rest.servlet.urlPattern. And the listening port in the configuration item servicecomb.rest.address must be consistent with the port that the tomcat listens on (the default is 8080, which can be modified by adding server.port in application.yml) After integrating java chassis, you can develop REST interface through it: @RestSchema(schemaId = \"hello\") @RequestMapping(path = \"/\") public class HelloService { @RequestMapping(path = \"hello\", method = RequestMethod.GET) public String sayHello(@RequestParam(name=\"name\") String name) { return \"Hello \" + name; } } Then you can access it by http://localhost:9093/hello?name=world. You can see that the tags used are mostly the same as Spring MVC. But there are also a few different places, such as: Replace RestController with RestSchema Declare @RequestMapping explicitly. If the business code is not a new development but based on the development of Spring MVC, now the java chassis is based on the transformation, but also need to pay attention to the disabling of the DispatcherServlet, and its related features will no longer take effect. In the following sections, about web JAVA application mode and web development mode, we'll introduce some details of the differences in Spring MVC mode.","title":"Web development method development"}]}
